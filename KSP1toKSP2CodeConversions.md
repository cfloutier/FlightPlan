# KSP1 to KSP2 Code Conversion Notes
Many KSP2 mods are best developed with a clean sheet approach, but in some cases it may be advantageous to start with old code that was proven to work well in KSP2. This is particularly true where the KSP1 code is mainly or entirely math, like with orbital mechanics, etc. Math is math, and the equations and approches should not gennerally change in most cases. However there are defintiely changes from KSP1 to KSP2 in where certain properties are found!
Since this project is leveraging MechJeb Orbital Mechanics code developed for KSP1 that code needs to be modified so that the good equations and math are fed with the right values so that they'll produce the results needed. This file documents the changes that have been made KSP2-izing the KSP2 MJ code. If you've got a project where you want to adapt some KSP1 code to work in KSP2, then this may help get you started. If you find errors in the assumptions made here, please update this file and share it back!
